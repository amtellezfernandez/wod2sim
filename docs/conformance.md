# Conformance

The core conformance tier is the dependency-light adapter check for WOD2Sim.
It is intended for CI and for reviewers who do not have AlpaSim scene assets,
Docker, a GPU, torch, or private checkpoints.

```bash
make conformance
```

`make conformance` sets `WOD2SIM_CORE_CONFORMANCE=1` and runs the public test
suite with learned-policy checkpoint tests skipped. This keeps the core tier
stable across machines that may or may not have torch installed.

## Coverage

| Adapter property | Evidence in the core tier |
| --- | --- |
| Public model registry is curated | Entry-point and installed-doctor tests expose `constant_velocity`, `route_following`, `token_dagger_bc`, and `direct_actor_planner`; only the first two are dependency-light public-core models. |
| Route geometry reaches policy code | Signal tests require `route_source=alpasim_waypoints` when route waypoints are present. |
| Command-proxy fallback is visible | Audit, batch-summary, and benchmark-summary tests retain route provenance. |
| Scene signal is behavior-neutral by default | Signal tests keep brightness/dynamics risk diagnostic-only unless structured hazards are present. |
| Trajectory output preserves adapter identity | Resampling identity, endpoint interpolation, and replay-identity tests cover the shared output contract. |
| Launch state is materialized | Setup and launcher tests check command files, metadata, AlpaSim checkout provenance, and Docker-image inspection fields. |
| Evidence can be audited without gated assets | Audit, support-bundle, batch-summary, benchmark-summary, and reproduction-manifest tests run on synthetic local artifacts. |

## Out Of Scope

The core tier is not a driving benchmark. It does not execute AlpaSim rollouts,
does not validate a learned checkpoint, and does not prove collision, progress,
or off-road performance. Those results require executed representative scenes,
appropriate baselines, and failure analysis.

Torch-dependent token-policy tests remain part of the normal test suite when
torch is installed, but they are intentionally excluded from core conformance so
CI can verify the public adapter without private model artifacts.
Direct-actor proxies, learned checkpoints, and restricted scene assets are
optional gated extensions for live evaluation, not prerequisites for the core
conformance tier.
