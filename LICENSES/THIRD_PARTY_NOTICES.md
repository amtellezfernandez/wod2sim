## NVIDIA AlpaSim override files

The AlpaSim override layers at
[`third_party/alpasim_overrides/`](../third_party/alpasim_overrides) and the packaged
copy at [`src/wod2sim/alpasim_overrides/`](../src/wod2sim/alpasim_overrides) contain
files derived from NVIDIA AlpaSim:

- `src/driver/src/alpasim_driver/models/__init__.py`
- `src/wizard/alpasim_wizard/deployment/docker_compose.py`
- portions of `local_checkout.patch` and `route_waypoints.patch` that quote
  upstream AlpaSim source in patch context

## NVIDIA AlpaSim run media

[`artifacts/external/alpasim_navsim_reactive_rollout/camera-map.mp4`](../artifacts/external/alpasim_navsim_reactive_rollout/camera-map.mp4)
and its
[`animated README preview`](../docs/assets/readme/alpasim-closed-loop.gif)
contain AlpaSim map output and a recorded camera frame from the official public
AlpaSim fixture
`src/runtime/tests/data/mock_video_model/clipgt-0b10bce8-61f1-4350-8577-cf3c9493ffc3.usdz`
at upstream commit `9177bd0bec547d7516cc77d1864e943780ef7e7a`.
The exact source URL and SHA-256 are recorded in the retained
[`manifest`](../artifacts/external/alpasim_navsim_reactive_rollout/manifest.json).

## NAVSIM EgoStatusMLP reference implementation and checkpoint

[`src/wod2sim/simulator/navsim_ego_status_mlp.py`](../src/wod2sim/simulator/navsim_ego_status_mlp.py)
reproduces the published EgoStatusMLP architecture and input/output contract
from NAVSIM v1.1 source commit
`0811876c274e8b058ab2be9b3dcd4d37bd23f177`. The replay runner downloads the
official `ego_status_mlp_seed_0` checkpoint from
`autonomousvision/navsim_baselines` at revision
`32d89c0ae6e7c13c311f4a034002006c250afab0` and verifies SHA-256
`87d75b0f43d077ac3531370d7cccac98656d4e9b5ce5fa6618e28b7358b3a86b`.
The checkpoint is not redistributed in this repository.
